Experiments with the IRIS dataset from Kaggle.com for DATA 550

The purpose of this repository is to get familiar with the IRIS dataset that is on [kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com/). This particular dataset is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris). We will be using this dataset for Project 1 for DATA 550 at Mercyhurst University, in Erie, PA.

## Files
Included in this repository are the data files from kaggle.  Along with these 2 files, are the Jupyter Notebook files that will contain notes, code, and results from testing against the IRIS dataset.

The main experiment file is iris-experiments.ipynb. This file contains both pygal and matplotlib charts, however Kaggle does not support pygal.  So the file on Kaggle is iris-experiments-kaggle.ipynb

## Libraries
Some libraries I will be using in this repository are:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. pygal
5. seaborn
